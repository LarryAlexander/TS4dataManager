## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🚨 For Critical Security Issues

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@[your-domain]` (or create a private security advisory)
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Your contact information
3. **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours

## Security Considerations

### 🔒 Data Protection

- **Local First**: All data stored locally on user's machine
- **No Telemetry**: No data transmitted to external servers by default
- **File Permissions**: Respects OS-level file system permissions
- **Path Validation**: Prevents path traversal attacks

### 🛡️ Platform Security

#### Windows

- **Code Signing**: Planned for stable releases
- **Antivirus**: May trigger false positives (unsigned executable)
- **Permissions**: Requests minimal required permissions
- **Registry**: No registry modifications

#### macOS

- **Gatekeeper**: Unsigned during beta, will be notarized for release
- **Sandboxing**: Currently not sandboxed (requires file system access)
- **Permissions**: May request file access permissions
- **Keychain**: No keychain access required

#### Linux

- **AppArmor/SELinux**: Should work with default policies
- **File Permissions**: Follows standard Unix permissions
- **Dependencies**: Minimal system dependencies
- **Package Security**: Distributed as standalone binary

### 🔐 Application Security

#### File Operations

- **Path Sanitization**: All file paths validated and sanitized
- **Symlink Protection**: Prevents following malicious symlinks
- **Permission Checks**: Verifies read/write permissions before operations
- **Atomic Operations**: File operations designed to be atomic where possible

#### Memory Safety

- **Dart/Flutter**: Memory-safe language prevents buffer overflows
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Resource Limits**: Prevents excessive memory/CPU usage

#### Configuration

- **Secure Defaults**: All features default to secure configurations
- **Validation**: Configuration values validated for safety
- **Isolation**: Profiles are isolated from each other

## Security Best Practices for Users

### 🏠 Safe Installation

1. **Download Source**: Only download from official GitHub releases
2. **Checksum Verification**: Verify file hashes when provided
3. **Antivirus Scan**: Scan downloads with your antivirus software
4. **Backup**: Keep backups of important Sims 4 data

### 🔧 Safe Configuration

1. **Storage Locations**: Choose secure, backed-up storage locations
2. **Permissions**: Don't run with elevated privileges unless necessary
3. **Network Drives**: Be cautious with network-attached storage
4. **Shared Computers**: Consider profile privacy on shared systems

### 📁 Safe Usage

1. **Regular Backups**: Always maintain separate backups of your saves
2. **Test Restores**: Test snapshot restores in safe environments first
3. **Profile Isolation**: Keep different mod setups in separate profiles
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep the application updated for security fixes

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

### Our Process

1. **Receipt**: Acknowledge vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 1 week
3. **Fix Development**: Security fix development (timeline varies by severity)
4. **Testing**: Internal testing and validation
5. **Release**: Security release with advisory
6. **Disclosure**: Public disclosure 30 days after fix release
