# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, GUI framework
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, file safety tests
   → Core: models, services, GUI components, version control
   → Integration: mod manager detection, file monitoring, backup systems
   → Polish: unit tests, user experience validation, help documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3

**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

- [ ] T004 [P] File backup integrity test in tests/contract/test_backup_system.py
- [ ] T005 [P] Version tracking test in tests/contract/test_version_control.py
- [ ] T006 [P] Integration test mod detection in tests/integration/test_mod_manager_integration.py
- [ ] T007 [P] Integration test GUI workflow in tests/integration/test_user_interface.py

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

- [ ] T008 [P] Sims 4 directory model in src/models/sims4_directory.py
- [ ] T009 [P] Version control service in src/services/version_service.py
- [ ] T010 [P] GUI main window in src/gui/main_window.py
- [ ] T011 File backup system implementation
- [ ] T012 Mod change detection system
- [ ] T013 User-friendly error handling
- [ ] T014 Activity logging and monitoring

## Phase 3.4: Integration

- [ ] T015 Connect to Sims 4 file system
- [ ] T016 Mod manager compatibility layer
- [ ] T017 Real-time file monitoring
- [ ] T018 Automatic backup scheduling

## Phase 3.5: Polish

- [ ] T019 [P] Unit tests for validation in tests/unit/test_validation.py
- [ ] T020 Performance tests (<200ms)
- [ ] T021 [P] Update docs/api.md
- [ ] T022 Remove duplication
- [ ] T023 Run manual-testing.md

## Dependencies

- Tests (T004-T007) before implementation (T008-T014)
- T008 blocks T009, T015
- T016 blocks T018
- Implementation before polish (T019-T023)

## Parallel Example

```
# Launch T004-T007 together:
Task: "Contract test POST /api/users in tests/contract/test_users_post.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/users/{id} in tests/contract/test_users_get.py"
Task: "Integration test registration in tests/integration/test_registration.py"
Task: "Integration test auth in tests/integration/test_auth.py"
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules

_Applied during main() execution_

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
3. **From User Stories**:

   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked by main() before returning_

- [ ] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [ ] All entities have model tasks
- [ ] All tests come before implementation
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
