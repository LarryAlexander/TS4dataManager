# TS4 Data Manager Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All features MUST prioritize the needs of casual Sims 4 modders who lack technical expertise.
Every interface element MUST be intuitive, clearly labeled, and provide helpful tooltips or guidance.
Complex operations MUST be abstracted behind simple GUI controls with clear visual feedback.
The application MUST never require users to interact with command lines, file paths, or technical configurations directly.

### II. Non-Destructive Operations

All data management operations MUST be reversible through version tracking and snapshots.
Before any modification to user files (saves, mods, worlds), the system MUST create automatic backups.
Users MUST be able to restore any previous state of their Sims 4 data with a single click.
Deletion operations MUST move files to a recoverable staging area, not permanent deletion.

### III. Git-Style Version Control

The application MUST implement git-like version tracking for all Sims 4 data directories.
Each change to mods, saves, or worlds MUST be tracked with timestamps, descriptions, and diff summaries.
Users MUST be able to view change history, compare versions, and revert to any previous state.
The version control system MUST operate transparently without requiring user understanding of git concepts.

### IV. Mod Manager Integration

The application MUST work alongside existing mod managers without conflicts or interference.
File operations MUST respect mod manager structures and avoid breaking existing workflows.
The system MUST detect and integrate with popular mod managers (Mod Organizer 2, Vortex, etc.) when present.
Mod changes made through external tools MUST be automatically detected and tracked.

### V. Safe File Management

All file operations MUST include integrity checks and validation before execution.
The system MUST detect and prevent operations that could corrupt save files or break mod dependencies.
Users MUST receive clear warnings before potentially risky operations with detailed explanations.
Automated file organization MUST preserve original file relationships and mod load orders.

## Data Protection Standards

The application MUST implement multiple layers of data protection:

- Automatic periodic snapshots of all tracked directories
- Real-time monitoring for file corruption or unexpected changes
- Quarantine system for suspicious or potentially harmful mods
- Emergency recovery mode to restore from catastrophic data loss

## User Experience Requirements

The GUI MUST follow modern usability principles:

- Visual hierarchy that guides users through complex operations
- Progress indicators for all long-running operations
- Contextual help and educational tooltips throughout the interface
- Accessibility compliance for users with disabilities
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes and resolutions

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and design decisions.
All features and changes MUST be evaluated against these core principles before implementation.
Any deviation from these principles requires explicit documentation and user impact assessment.
The constitution may only be amended through formal review process with stakeholder approval.

All code reviews MUST verify compliance with user-centric design and data protection principles.
Feature complexity MUST be justified in terms of user value, not technical elegance.
Development decisions MUST prioritize user safety and data integrity over performance optimizations.
