# Feature Specification: Project Foundation ‚Äî TS4 Data Manager

**Feature Branch**: `001-specify-let-s`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "/specify Let's start to map out the foundatinon for the project. As i stated before the goal is to create a GUI-git styled sims 4 manager this should allow for simple version tracking between their saves, mods, pictures, recordings and so on. I want to create something that caters to simple users and mod users to help with reverting changes maybe diagnosing most recent installed mod or bugs and so on. This is ment to live alongside their mod manager. As a full sims 4 manager."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas for Sims 4 modding**:
   - Mod manager compatibility requirements
   - File backup and versioning strategies
   - User interface complexity levels
   - Sims 4 directory structure handling
   - Save file integrity protection
   - Rollback and recovery scenarios

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26

- Q: Which platforms do you want to support at launch? ‚Üí A: Windows and macOS (same features)
- Q: Which mod managers should we validate compatibility with at launch? ‚Üí A: Generic detection, Vortex, MO2, CurseForge
- Q: What snapshot retention policy should we enforce by default? ‚Üí A: Storage budget cap (default 5 GB; configurable)
- Q: Which destination should be used for any telemetry/crash reporting? ‚Üí A: GitHub issue auto-draft export (no network; prepares an issue with logs)
- Q: What initial scan performance target should we meet on a typical Mods folder? ‚Üí A: Best effort with progress + ETA; no strict p95 target
- Q: Do we need to support multiple Sims 4 libraries/profiles per machine? ‚Üí A: Multiple profiles selectable; user-chosen storage location; export/import supported; internal IDs hidden
- Q: Privacy posture? ‚Üí A: Telemetry OFF by default; no analytics; diagnostic export is manual only

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As a Sims 4 player who uses mods and is not technical, I want an easy, GUI-based way to see what changed in my Sims 4 folders (mods, saves, screenshots, recordings) and quickly revert unwanted changes, so I can diagnose issues like a recently installed mod breaking my game without learning complex tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given a Sims 4 user folder is initialized for tracking, When a new mod file is added to the Mods directory and the application is opened, Then the application displays a new change entry in the history with the mod filename, timestamp, and affected path, and provides a one-click option to revert the change.
2. Given a previously working save is now corrupted, When the user selects a snapshot from before the corruption in the application, Then the application restores the save files to the selected snapshot and preserves the current (corrupted) state as a recoverable backup.
3. Given a user manages mods using an external mod manager, When that manager adds, updates, or removes files while the application is running or on next open, Then the application detects and records those external changes without interfering with the manager and shows them in the change history.
4. Given the user is unsure which recent mod caused issues, When the user opens the "Recent Changes" view, Then the application highlights newly added or modified mods since the last known-good snapshot and allows the user to temporarily disable or revert them non-destructively.
5. Given the user wants separate setups, When they create a new profile and choose a storage location, Then the app creates the profile at that location, shows it in the profile selector with a friendly label (not the folder name), and sets it as active without exposing internal IDs.
6. Given a user wants to preserve their entire current state, When they choose "Export Profile" for the active profile, Then the app packages Saves, Mods, Options, Screenshots, and Recordings into a portable archive with a manifest and human-readable import instructions, shows progress/ETA, and allows cancel with rollback.
7. Given a user has a valid exported archive, When they choose "Import Profile" and select the archive, Then the app validates integrity and version, presents a guided placement flow (including storage location selection), and activates the imported profile upon success.

### Edge Cases

- Very large Mods directory causes first-time tracking to take a long time ‚Üí progress indicator and ability to pause/resume.
- Game running locks some files ‚Üí application informs user and offers to retry after game closes.
- External cloud sync (e.g., OneDrive, iCloud Drive) modifies timestamps ‚Üí changes should still be tracked accurately.
- Low disk space during snapshot or restore ‚Üí operation blocked with a clear message and required free space estimate.
- Permission issues on folders ‚Üí guided fix with minimal steps.
- Special characters or long paths in filenames ‚Üí fully supported.
- Partial restore interruption (app closed/crash) ‚Üí automatic rollback to pre-operation state on next start.
- Multiple tracked areas (Mods/Saves/Options/Screenshots/Recordings) with independent histories ‚Üí consistent user experience across areas.
- User selects a custom profile storage path that later moves or becomes unavailable ‚Üí app detects and prompts to locate or relink; does not delete data.
- Export archive becomes very large due to videos/recordings ‚Üí app estimates size in advance, warns about disk space, and allows deselecting bulky areas before export.
- Import archive version mismatch or partial/corrupted archive ‚Üí app blocks import with clear errors and suggests next steps (e.g., re-download/rebuild export).
- Profile label conflicts or duplicate labels ‚Üí app allows duplicate labels but uses hidden internal IDs to disambiguate; UI clarifies active selection.
- User expects to see underlying folder names ‚Üí UI intentionally shows only labels and helpful descriptions; never exposes internal IDs.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a GUI that enables all core tasks without requiring any command-line usage.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST support tracking of the following Sims 4 directories: Mods, Saves, Options (game settings/config), Screenshots (Pictures), and Video Recordings.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST maintain a chronological change history for tracked directories, including timestamps, file paths, and operation type (added/modified/deleted/moved).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST enable users to create and label snapshots manually and MUST create automatic pre-change backups for potentially destructive operations.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST allow one-click restore to any prior snapshot, preserving the current state as a recoverable backup.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST detect changes made by external tools (e.g., mod managers) and include them in the change history without interfering with those tools.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide a "Recent Changes" view that highlights newly added or modified items since a selected baseline.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST support a non-destructive delete (move to a recoverable staging area) for any removal initiated from the application.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST present clear warnings and confirmations before risky operations (e.g., overwriting saves, bulk deletes), with a rationale and recovery instructions.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST provide integrity checks to detect likely save corruption or incomplete mod installs and guide the user to safe recovery actions.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST provide progress indicators for long-running operations (initial scan, large restore, snapshot creation).
- **FR-012**: The system MUST offer basic search and filtering in history (by folder area, file type, time window, change type).
- **FR-013**: The system MUST provide accessible UI (keyboard navigable, readable contrast, scalable text).
- **FR-014**: The system MUST include an onboarding flow that locates the Sims 4 user folder automatically where possible and allows manual selection.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST log user-initiated operations (snapshot, restore, revert) to a human-readable activity log.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST allow users to configure which areas (Mods/Saves/Screenshots/Recordings) are tracked and which are excluded.
- **FR-017**: The system MUST support safe preview of a restore plan (which files will be changed) before execution.
- **FR-018**: The system MUST operate alongside popular mod managers without corrupting or locking their files.
- **FR-019**: The system MUST provide a simple way to revert only recently added or modified mods without affecting unrelated files.
- **FR-020**: The system MUST support scheduling of periodic snapshots (e.g., daily/weekly) with configurable retention.

- **FR-021**: The system MUST support Windows and macOS at launch with feature parity.
- **FR-022**: The system MUST validate compatibility with Generic file change detection, Vortex, Mod Organizer 2 (MO2), and CurseForge at launch.
- **FR-023**: The system MUST enforce a storage budget retention policy for snapshots with a default cap of 5 GB (configurable by the user). When the cap is reached, the system MUST prompt the user to auto-prune older snapshots or adjust the cap.
- **FR-024**: The system MUST keep telemetry and analytics OFF by default. No background data collection. Diagnostic export is a manual, user-initiated local package only.
- **FR-027**: The system MUST provide a diagnostic export that prepares a GitHub issue draft locally with redacted logs and metadata; no automatic network calls are made, and the user reviews/submits manually.
- **FR-025**: The system MUST provide a best‚Äëeffort initial scan with clear progress and ETA estimation, and MUST communicate that duration varies with mod count and file volume; no strict latency (p95) target is enforced.
  // Profiles & Instances
- **FR-026**: The system MUST support multiple profiles selectable in the app. Users MUST be able to choose the storage location for their profiles.
- **FR-028**: Profiles MUST use user-friendly labels in the UI while internal identifiers remain hidden from users.
- **FR-029**: The system MUST allow exporting a profile as a portable archive containing the user‚Äôs current instance (full state across Saves, Mods, Options, Screenshots, Recordings) plus a manifest and import instructions.
- **FR-030**: The system MUST allow importing a previously exported profile archive with validation, safety checks, and a guided placement flow.
- **FR-031**: Long-running profile operations (export/import) MUST display progress and ETA, and MUST be cancelable with safe rollback to the pre-operation state.
